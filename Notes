Interesting questions:

- Do players in cars fare better?
  - Can use placement and death info crossed with distance walked/distance drove
  - Generally how does movement correlate with success?

- What are the best sniping spots?
  - Look for positions with high concentrations of long range kills and/or kills with long range weapons

- Where are the best spots for scraps (close range)?

- Average difference in placement between killer and victim?
  - Try to dig into the disparity in skill


NEXT STEPS:
    - Enrich dataset with kill distance
    - Set up a pipeline for taking a file in, adding enriched fields and saving it
    - Look into tests for this
    - EDA on kill distance and placement to find best sniper positions
